# Project Handover: Exam ASD S1 2025-26

## Project Overview
This repository contains exam materials and extracted code for the "ASD" (Algorithms and Data Structures) course, Semester 1, 2025-2026.

## Current State
- **PDF Documents**: 11 exam/document PDFs safely stored in the root directory.
- **Extracted Code**: Code snippets extracted from the documents are located in the `extracted_code/` directory as Markdown files.
- **Version Control**: Repository initialized and pushed to `https://github.com/AbderBouzi/exam_ing25-26.git`.

## Repository Structure
```
.
├── doc*.pdf             # Original exam documents
├── extracted_code/      # Folder containing markdown files with extracted code
└── HANDOVER.md          # This file
```

## Next Steps for the Incoming Agent
1.  **Content Analysis**: Review the extracted code in `extracted_code/` to understand the specific algorithms or data structures covered (likely C/C++ or pseudocode based on typical ASD curriculums).
2.  **Solution Generation**: Verify if the extracted code requires debugging, completion, or if solutions need to be implemented for the exam questions.
3.  **Organization**: Consider renaming the PDFs and extracted files to more descriptive names if content analysis reveals their specific topics (e.g., `recursion_exam.pdf`, `linked_lists_code.md`).
